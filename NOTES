Reward function:
    reward the model each time the sum of it's cards ranks decreases
    reward the model when the number of cards decreases
    the relationship between the reduction of number of cards and
    reduction of total rank should (could) be defined i.e.
    If I play 2 cards both of rank 3 and two cards both of rank 6,
    the reward should be higher for the second case
